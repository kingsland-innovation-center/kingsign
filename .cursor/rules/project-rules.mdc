Context about the Kingsign platform:
    Core Features
        1. Workspace Creation
            - Users can create distinct Workspaces to manage document signing activities.
            - Each workspace acts as a container for templates, documents, and collaborators.
        2. Document Templates
            - Users can define Document Templates containing various field types:
            - ‚úçÔ∏è Signature
            - üñäÔ∏è Text Inputs
            - üìÖ Dates, and more
            - Templates can be reused across multiple documents for efficiency.

        3. Document Generation and Sign Url
            - From templates, users can create Documents ready for signing.
            - Generate a Secure Signing Link for each document.
            - Signers use this link to access a clean, intuitive **Document Signing View**, where they can complete only their assigned fields.

        4. Document Signing Experience
            - The dedicated **Signing View** offers a focused and user-friendly interface:
            - No need for the signer to create an account.
            - Real-time field validation ensures accurate input.

        5. Document Downloading
